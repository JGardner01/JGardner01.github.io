<h2>Employment</h2>
<h4>Tesco Northampton South Extra, Store Assistant (November 2020 - Present)</h4>
<p>As a store assistant, I primarily work in the beers, wines and spirits department, with additional responsibilities in the grocery department when needed. This role has strongly enhanced my teamwork and communication skills, as I frequently work alongside colleagues and engage with numerous customers daily. I have also developed strong time management skills and the ability to work effectively under pressure, particularly during busy periods of the year, where I am given additional tasks such as setting up displays and promotional ends while also maintaining the appearance and stock levels of the aisles that I am responsible for. This has greatly improved my ability to prioritise and manage tasks efficiently.</p>
