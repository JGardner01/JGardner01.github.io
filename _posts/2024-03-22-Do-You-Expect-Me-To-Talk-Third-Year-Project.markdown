## Overview
The Do You Expect Me To Talk? project is my third year project that I developed at Lancaster University. This project addresses key challenges in modern digital communication by creating an intuitive, no app based system that prioritises privacy, ensures universal accessibility, and provides a user friendly experience. The project provides users with a platform to engage in voice, video and text based communication as well as the ability to share files over a local network, all without requiring personal information or relying on centralised servers.

Created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and WebRTC, and then deployed on Heroku, the application enables multiple devices to form a Personal Area Network (PAN), allowing seamless peer to peer communication. This includes the exchange of messages, media files and real time video and voice streams. By using WebRTC to facilitate the media streams and data transfer, the system ensures that all data remains private, as it is transmitted directly between devices over a peer to peer connection without passing through a centralised servers.

**The key aims of the project focus on the following aspects:**
1.	**Functionality:** Allow users to securely create and manage a Personal Area Network (PAN) and enable communication within the network via text, voice, video and file sharing between trusted devices.
2.	**Privacy:** No personal information is required to use the application. The communication remains completely peer to peer, ensuring no data is stored on external servers.
3.	**Universal Accessibility:** A no app based system that is available to all digital devices given they have a web browser, removing the need for software installation and making the platform easily and widely accessible.
4.	**Enhanced Usability:** A user friendly interface that focuses on simple navigation and allowing the functionality to be performed effortlessly, addressing common frustrations with other third-party applications.

By focusing on these aims the project was able to provide a comprehensive, privacy focused and accessible solution to many of the complexities of modern communication systems.

## System Functionality


## Demo
Here is a demonstration of using the application where Connect a desktop, laptop and mobile device are added to personal area network where images can be shared as well as text and video communications can be made.
