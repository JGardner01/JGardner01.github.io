## Overview
The File Organiser is a JavaFX based utility application designed to help users automate the organisation of files within their chosen directories. It provides an efficient and customisable way to sort files based on file types or creation data, reducing manual work and helping users maintain a clean, organised file system. This tool is particularly useful for individuals dealing with large volumes of files. By automatically sorting files into predefined categories based on file type or date, File Organiser saves time and effort, making it easy to manage and maintain an organised file structure with minimal user intervention.

## Features
- **Automated File Organisation:** Automatically sorts files into categories according to the user's organisation criteria.
- **System Tray Integration:** Application runs in the background with easy access from the system tray.
- **Custom File Extensions:** Allows users to define and manage custom file extensions for sorting.
- **Customisable Settings:** Personalise the application's behaviour by adjusting the default directory path and choosing whether to run the application in the background.

## Customisation
- **Custom File Extensions:** Define and manage both custom and predefined file extensions using the Manage File Extension user interface.
- **Organisation Preferences:** Configure organisation criteria to control how files are organised and which directories are sorted.
- **Application Behaviour:** Customise how the application operates, including options to run automatic organisation in the background and specify the default directory path.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java:** The core programming language used in the application.
- **JavaFX:** For building a rich and responsive user interface.
- **Maven:** For project management and build automation.

## Conclusion
The File Organiser project demonstrates my ability to develop efficient, user-friendly tools that automate repetitive organisation tasks. By utilising JavaFX, I was able to build a feature-rich application that simplifies file management for users, enabling them to save time and keep their file systems well-organized. This project showcases my skills in developing both functional and highly customisable applications.
