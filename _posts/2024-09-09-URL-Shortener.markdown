## Overview
The URL Shortener project is a Flask based web application that enables users to create customisable, shortened URLs along with generating the corresponding QR codes. It features an intuitive dashboard for URL management and monitoring. Users can create accounts to save and monitor their links across different browser sessions and devices or manage them temporarily within browser sessions. The application uses Python and Flask for the backend, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend with MongoDB for database management. Google Safe Browsing API is integrated within the application to ensure all shortened links are non-malicious.
